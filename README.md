# Jenkins Continuous Integration and Deployment Pipeline

## Overview

This repository contains the Jenkins pipeline configuration for a project that demonstrates how to automate the build, test, and deployment processes using Jenkins and GitHub. This setup is designed to showcase a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline with email notifications at key stages.

## Project Structure

- **Jenkinsfile**: Contains all pipeline definitions for the build, test, and deployment phases.
- **src/**: Source directory for the project files.
- **tests/**: Contains unit and integration test scripts.

## Pipeline Stages

1. **Build**: Compiles the code and packages it into an executable or library.
2. **Unit and Integration Tests**: Runs tests to ensure the application functions as expected.
3. **Code Analysis**: Performs static code analysis to maintain code quality.
4. **Security Scan**: Scans the codebase for security vulnerabilities.
5. **Deploy to Staging**: Deploys the application to a staging environment for further testing.
6. **Integration Tests on Staging**: Executes additional integration tests in a staging environment.
7. **Deploy to Production**: Deploys the application to the production environment.
